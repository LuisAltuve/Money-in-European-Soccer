    "&emsp; As long as there is money to be made from professional sports, money will play a role in an individual's or team's success. In soccer, club owners will look to invest in a variety of ways in hopes to improve the team, leading to higher quality play and an increasing fanbase as a result. These investments can be used for improved training facilities, improved medical facilities, stadium renovations, hiring better coaches, hiring data analysts and scientists, etc... All these improvements across the club can have big impacts on a team's success but each game is still won and lost on the field and having the right players to make the most these advantages is critical. \n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; For this reason, the biggest investments from owners often come in the form of an increased transfer budget so the team can pay a transfer fee to acquire a desirable player currently under contract with another team. Through this process of buying and selling players in the 'transfer market', the best players are brought in for large fees to the best clubs year after year. In this project, I aim to examine how the money spent on transfers affects the final league position of a team in their domestic league."

    "### Scraping Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Headers and Delay\n",
    "&emsp; Unfortunately, 'Transfermarkt.us' was a little particular about how it received a request so I had to disguise my requests with the 'headers' parameter and add a delay using python's 'time' library in between requests to seem like a normal web surfer. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top Ten Teams\n",
    "&emsp; I elected to scrape the results of the top ten teams (Based on current players' market value) of each league instead of all the teams in the league because promotion and relegation from and to the lower leagues meant that some of the other teams in the league would be more likely to be in and out of the 'First Tier'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starting Rows\n",
    "&emsp; In my initial scraping attempts (Note that the pickle file is 'v3'), I thought that every page carrying the equivalent information of each team would be similarily structured. It turned out that most teams' transfer activity was tracked from the following season (24/25) but teams that already had a deal to sign a player for the 25/26 season started then. This lead to mismatched season and transfer information so I had to be more specific about where to start scraping from.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/transfers.jpg'>\n",
    "\n",
    "After this mistake I made sure to confirm I was starting from the correct row for the 'transfer balance' data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### League Position Information\n",
    "&emsp; With the transfer information secured, I also needed each team's final league position for each season. Fortunately there was a page on the site that held that information as well a bit of extra information about each season. The downside to using a transfers focused website to collect all my data was that information not pertaining to transfers was not as carefully archived.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/league.jpg'>\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; For this team there is no record of the seasons between 95/96 and 00/01. Had I not noticed this problem, the data for the 95/96 season would've erroneously been assigned to the 99/00 season, 94/95 to 98/99, and so on. To solve this problem I implemented a way to only assign the info from the 'League rankings' page row if the season matched the season of the transfer information. This meant that some rows would have missing information about the league that season but would still have the correct transfer information and league position (if rows were missing it was because the team was in a lower league at the time and therefore their position could be marked as 'â‰¤10')"
